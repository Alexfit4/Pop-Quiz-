# Pop-Quiz-

## Inscructions:

1. Design a timed quiz website.
2. When user clicks btuton to start the quiz the countdown begins.
3. After the user clicks on "Click here to start" a new page will be shown with a multiple choice question for the user to answer.
4. After the user clicks on "Sumbit Answer" the user will then be notified if the users answer was correct or incorrect. If the user was correct then a point is added to their overall quiz score. If not the user will lose 5 seconds off the remaining time they have left.
5. Once the user finishes the quiz or if all the time ran out, the user will be shown a screen to input there first name and their name will be logged and will be available to see if they click on the "View High Score" on the top right of the page, where they can see who else has taken the quiz and there final score.
